## üéØ What It Does

Mecca X is an innovative all-in-one security testing platform that combines:

- **Passive Reconnaissance** - Discovers hidden subdomains without touching the target
- **Vulnerability Scanning** - Deep scans for security holes with real-time CVE matching
- **Active Exploitation Check** - Validates if vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild
- **Network Mapping** - Scans entire networks and builds attack graphs showing pivot paths
- **Auto-Exploitation** - Safely validates vulnerabilities with proof-of-concept tests
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Runs scheduled scans and alerts on NEW vulnerabilities
- **Bug Bounty Reports** - Auto-generates professional reports with bounty estimates

## üöÄ Key Features

### Speed & Innovation
- **3-5x faster** than traditional tools using parallel processing
- **50 concurrent DNS checks** for rapid subdomain validation
- **4 data sources** running simultaneously (Subfinder, Amass, crt.sh, HackerTarget)
- **Auto-identifies high-value targets** (admin, api, dev, staging subdomains)

### Intelligence & Automation
- **Real-time threat intelligence** from CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities database
- **Automated exploit matching** to Metasploit modules and Exploit-DB
- **Attack chain detection** showing lateral movement opportunities
- **Smart prioritization** based on exploitability and impact

### Professional Output
- **Executive summaries** for non-technical stakeholders
- **Bug bounty formatted reports** with estimated reward values
- **Continuous monitoring** with change detection and alerts
